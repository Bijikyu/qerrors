# Functional Demo Overview\n\nThis repository includes a self-contained frontend demo at the repository root that exercises error analysis tooling flows in a standalone, client-side environment. It does not require Bun or any server-side AI calls; all flows are mocked to demonstrate UI/UX and integration points.\n\n## How to run\n- Ensure dependencies are installed: `npm install`\n- Start the static demo server: `npm run demo-server` (listens on port 8080 by default)\n- Open `http://localhost:8080/demo.html` in a browser.\n\n## What the demo covers\n- Error generation and context capture\n- Mock AI analysis with caching behavior\n- Enqueue/dequeue and backoff simulation for a processing queue\n- Basic health and configuration UI scaffolding\n- Live metrics visualization (counts of errors, cache hits, AI analyses, etc.)\n\n## Next steps\n- If you want to prune or simplify flows, I can tailor the UI to focus on a subset of scenarios.\n
